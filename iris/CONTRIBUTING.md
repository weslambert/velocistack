# Contributing to DFIR-IRIS
*This applies to any repository present in the DFIR-IRIS organisation.* 

We are an open project, and we gladly accept contributions of any kinds. The two main ways to contribute are by 
creating issues or submitting pull requests.  

## Issues 
Please try to follow the templates that are provided for feature requests and bugs. Also ensure that you feature or issue
is not already mentioned in the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dfir-iris/projects/1/views/4). If an issue is similar 
but not fit perfectly with what you have in mind, you can add comments to it, and it will take into account.  

If you want to report a security issue, please read the [security page](./SECURITY.md).   

## Pull requests 
Please make sure to follow the [code guideline](./CODESTYLE.md) when writing your code.  
The pull requests must be submitted on the `develop` branch of the project. Ensure that before submitting you are 
up-to-date with it.  

## Others 
If you have any ideas not directly link to the code itself, you can directly contact us by [email](mailto:contact@dfir-iris.org).
